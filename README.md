Here are the data for the project: 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

1.) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3.) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5.) From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Please refer to CodeBook.md for the breakdown of all the variables listed in the "summary.txt" that was available on the assignment submission page.

### Execution instructions:
- install the "dplyr" package
- open an R console and run the following command:
source("run_analysis.R")
- From this point, the full dataset will be available in the R object labeled "combinedSets"
